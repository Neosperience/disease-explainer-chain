Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and Other Motor Neuron Diseases (MNDs), such as Lou Gehrig Disease or Charcot Syndrome;"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and other motor neuron diseases are characterized by steady, relentless, progressive degeneration of corticospinal tracts, anterior horn cells, bulbar motor nuclei, or a combination. Symptoms vary in severity and may include muscle weakness and atrophy, fasciculations, emotional lability, and respiratory muscle weakness. Diagnosis involves nerve conduction studies, electromyography, and exclusion of other disorders with MRI and laboratory testing. Treatment is supportive. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is the most common motor neuron disease (MND). MNDs may involve the central nervous system (CNS) as well as the peripheral nervous system. Usually, etiology is unknown. However, approximately 15% of cases are hereditary; they result from mutations in the superoxide dismutase (SOD) 1 gene (1). Nomenclature and symptoms vary according to the part of the motor system most affected. Myopathies have similar features but are disorders of the muscle membrane, contractile apparatus, or organelles. MNDs can be classified as upper and lower; some disorders (eg, ALS) have features of both. MNDs are more common among men, most often appearing during their 50s. General reference 1.

Expert Opin Ther Targets 24 (4):295–310, 2020. doi: 10.1080/14728222.2020.1738390 Epub 2020 Mar 14. Symptoms and Signs of ALS and Other MNDs: Upper MNDs (eg, primary lateral sclerosis) affect neurons of the motor cortex, which extend to the brain stem (corticobulbar tracts) or spinal cord (corticospinal tracts). Generally, symptoms consist of stiffness, clumsiness, and awkward movements, usually affecting first the mouth, throat, or both, then spreading to the limbs. Lower MNDs affect the anterior horn cells or cranial nerve motor nuclei or their efferent axons to the skeletal muscles. In bulbar palsies, only the cranial nerve motor nuclei in the brain stem (bulbar nuclei) are affected. Patients usually present with facial weakness, dysphagia, and dysarthria. When anterior horn cells of spinal (not cranial) nerves are affected, as in spinal muscular atrophies, symptoms usually include muscle weakness and atrophy, fasciculations (visible muscle twitches), and muscle cramps, initially in a hand, a foot, or the tongue. Poliomyelitis, an enteroviral infection that attacks anterior horn cells, and postpolio syndrome are also lower MNDs. Physical findings help differentiate upper from lower MNDs (see table Distinguishing Upper From Lower Motor Neuron Lesions ) and weakness due to lower MNDs from that due to myopathy (see table Distinguishing the Cause of Muscle Weakness: Lower Motor Neuron Dysfunction vs Myopathy ). Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS): Most patients with ALS present with random, asymmetric symptoms, consisting of cramps, weakness, and muscle atrophy of the hands (most commonly) or feet. Weakness progresses to the forearms, shoulders, and lower limbs. Fasciculations, spasticity, hyperactive deep tendon reflexes, extensor plantar reflexes, clumsiness, stiffness of movement, weight loss, fatigue, and difficulty controlling facial expression and tongue movements soon follow. Other symptoms include hoarseness, dysphagia, and slurred and often nasal speech; because swallowing is difficult, salivation appears to increase, and patients tend to choke on liquids. Late in the disorder, a pseudobulbar affect occurs, with inappropriate, involuntary, and uncontrollable excesses of laughter or crying. Sensory systems, consciousness, cognition, voluntary eye movements, sexual function, and urinary and anal sphincters are usually spared. Death is usually caused by failure of the respiratory muscles; 50% of patients die within 3 years of onset, 20% live 5 years, and 10% live 10 years. Survival for > 30 years is rare. Progressive bulbar palsy and progressive pseudobulbar palsy: The bulbar muscles innervated by cranial nerves are predominantly affected in patients with progressive bulbar palsy, resulting from progressive degeneration of the motor neurons innervating bulbar musculature. This disorder causes progressive difficulty with chewing, swallowing, and talking; a nasal voice; reduced gag reflex; fasciculations and weak movement of the facial muscles and tongue; and weak palatal movement. Aspiration is a risk. The upper motor neuron equivalent of this disorder is progressive pseudobulbar palsy. This disorder affects the corticobulbar tract, descending to bulbar lower motor neurons, but spares the lower motor neurons in the brain stem, causing upper motor neuron weakness of the bulbar muscles. and thus is called pseudobulbar. Speech is spastic, patients cannot rapidly repeat syllables, (kakaka, tatata, lalala, bababa); gag reflex and jaw jerk are brisk. A pseudobulbar affect with emotional lability may also occur. Commonly, progressive bulbar palsy spreads, affecting extrabulbar segments; then it is called bulbar-variant ALS. Patients with dysphagia have a very poor prognosis; respiratory complications due to aspiration frequently result in death within 1 to 3 years. Progressive muscular atrophy: In many cases, especially those with childhood onset, inheritance of progressive muscular atrophy is autosomal recessive. Other cases are sporadic. The disorder can develop at any age. Anterior horn cell involvement occurs alone or is more prominent than corticospinal involvement, and progression tends to be more benign than that of other MNDs. Fasciculations may be the earliest manifestation. Muscle wasting and marked weakness begin in the hands and progress to the arms, shoulders, and legs, eventually becoming generalized. Deep tendon reflexes are hypoactive. Patients may survive ≥ 25 years. Primary lateral sclerosis: In primary lateral sclerosis, progressive muscle stiffness in the arms and legs occurs with spasticity and hyperreflexia during examination. Fasciculations and muscle atrophy are atypical for this predominantly upper motor neuron disorder. Survival is prolonged because risk of aspiration and pneumonia is low; several years must pass to result in total disability. Symptoms and signs reference 1.

Diagnosis of ALS and Other MNDs: Electrodiagnostic tests MRI of the brain and, if no cranial nerve involvement, cervical spine, Laboratory tests to check for other, treatable causes. Diagnosis of motor neuron diseases is suggested by progressive, generalized motor weakness without significant sensory abnormalities. Differential diagnosis: Other disorders that cause pure muscle weakness should be ruled out: Disorders of neuromuscular transmission, Various myopathies (including noninflammatory and drug-induced), Spinal muscular atrophies (mostly in children), Polymyositis, Dermatomyositis, Thyroid disorders and adrenal disorders, Electrolyte abnormalities (eg, hypokalemia, hypercalcemia, hypophosphatemia), Various infections (eg, syphilis, Lyme disease, hepatitis C), Autoimmune-mediated motor neuropathies, Cervical spinal stenosis, Behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia (15 to 20% develop motor neuron disease), Heavy metal toxicity (eg, lead, mercury). When cranial nerves are affected, a treatable cause is less likely. Upper and lower motor neuron signs plus weakness in facial muscles strongly suggest amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Testing Electrodiagnostic tests should be done to check for evidence of disorders of neuromuscular transmission or demyelination. Such evidence is not present in MNDs; nerve conduction velocities are usually normal until late in the disease. Needle electromyography (EMG) is the most useful test, showing fibrillations, positive waves, fasciculations, and sometimes giant motor units, even in unaffected limbs. Brain MRI is required. When there is no clinical or EMG evidence of cranial nerve motor weakness, MRI of the cervical spine is indicated to exclude structural lesions that may be compressing the spinal cord. Tensor diffusion brain MRI may show a pattern of iron deposition along the motor pathways; although the association requires confirmation, this pattern seems consistent with upper motor neuron involvement and supports a diagnosis of ALS in the appropriate clinical setting (1). Laboratory tests are done to check for treatable causes. Tests include complete blood count, electrolytes, creatine kinase, and thyroid function tests. Serum and urine protein electrophoresis with immunofixation is done to check for a paraprotein that is rarely associated with MNDs. Discovering an underlying paraproteinemia may indicate that the MND is paraneoplastic, and treatment of the paraproteinemia may ameliorate the MND. Antimyelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) antibodies are associated with a demyelinating motor neuropathy, which may mimic ALS. A 24-hour urine collection is done to check for heavy metals in patients who may have been exposed to them. Lumbar puncture may be done to exclude other clinically suspected disorders; if white blood cells or the protein level is elevated, an alternative diagnosis is likely. Serum tests for syphilis, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and measurement of certain antibodies (rheumatoid factor, Lyme titer, HIV, hepatitis C virus, antinuclear [ANA], anti-Hu [to check for anti-Hu paraneoplastic syndrome]) are indicated only if suggested by risk factors or history. Genetic testing (eg, for superoxide dismutase gene mutation or genetic abnormalities that cause spinal muscular atrophies) and enzyme measurements (eg, hexosaminidase A for Tay-Sachs disease) should not be done unless patients are interested in genetic counseling; disorders detected by these tests have no known specific treatments.

Sci Rep 10 (1):5199, 2020. doi: 10.1038/s41598-020-62049-0. Treatment of ALS and Other MNDs: Supportive care, Riluzole, Edaravone, Sodium phenylbutyrate/taurursodiol (a combination product), Tofersen (for ALS due to SOD1 mutation). The mainstay of care for patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is timely intervention to manage symptoms. A multidisciplinary team approach helps patients cope with progressive neurologic disability. No medication offers a substantial clinical benefit for patients with ALS. However, riluzole may provide limited improvement in survival (by 2 to 3 months) (1), and edaravone may slow the decline in function to some degree (2). Sodium phenylbutyrate/taurursodiol (a combination product) can also slow the decline in function (3). It may be given in addition to other medications. Tofersen is an antisense oligonucleotide that is offered to patients with ALS due to the SOD1 mutation; it has been shown to delay progression and must be given intrathecally (4). The following medications may help reduce symptoms: For spasticity, baclofen, For cramps, phenytoin, To decrease saliva production, a strong anticholinergic medication (eg, glycopyrrolate, amitriptyline, benztropine, trihexyphenidyl, transdermal hyoscine, atropine). For pseudobulbar affect, amitriptyline, fluvoxamine, or a combination of dextromethorphan and quinidine. In patients with progressive bulbar palsy, surgery to improve swallowing has had limited success. Treatment references: 1.

Dementia with Lewy Bodies and Parkinson Disease Dementia;"Lewy body dementia includes clinically diagnosed dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson disease dementia. Dementia with Lewy bodies is chronic cognitive deterioration characterized by cellular inclusions called Lewy bodies in the cytoplasm of cortical neurons. Parkinson disease dementia is cognitive deterioration characterized by Lewy bodies in the substantia nigra; it develops late in Parkinson disease. ""See also Overview of Delirium and Dementia and Dementia. Dementia is chronic, global, usually irreversible deterioration of cognition. Dementia with Lewy bodies is the 3rd most common dementia. Age of onset is typically > 60. Lewy bodies are spherical, eosinophilic, neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions composed of aggregates of alpha-synuclein, a synaptic protein. They occur in the cortex of patients who have dementia with Lewy bodies. Neurotransmitter levels and neuronal pathways between the striatum and the neocortex are abnormal. Lewy bodies also occur in the substantia nigra of patients with Parkinson disease, and dementia (Parkinson disease dementia) may develop late in the disease. About 40% of patients with Parkinson disease develop Parkinson disease dementia, usually after age 70 and about 10 to 15 years after Parkinson disease has been diagnosed. Because Lewy bodies occur in dementia with Lewy bodies and in Parkinson disease dementia, some experts think that the two disorders may be part of a more generalized synucleinopathy affecting the central and peripheral nervous systems. Lewy bodies sometimes occur in patients with Alzheimer disease, and patients with dementia with Lewy bodies may have neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Dementia with Lewy bodies, Parkinson disease, and Alzheimer disease overlap considerably. Further research is needed to clarify the relationships among them. Both dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson disease dementia have a progressive course with a poor prognosis. Dementia should not be confused with delirium, although cognition is disordered in both. The following usually helps distinguish dementia from delirium: Dementia affects mainly memory, is typically caused by anatomic changes in the brain, has slower onset, and is generally irreversible. Delirium affects mainly attention, is typically caused by acute illness or drug toxicity (sometimes life threatening), and is often reversible. Other specific characteristics also help distinguish the dementia and delirium (see table Differences Between Delirium and Dementia ). Symptoms and Signs: Dementia with Lewy bodies. Initial cognitive deterioration in dementia with Lewy bodies resembles that in other dementias. However, dementia with Lewy bodies often manifests with early and prominent deficits in attention, executive function, and visuoperceptual ability; prominent or persistent memory impairment tends to occur as the dementia progresses. Extrapyramidal symptoms (typically including rigidity, bradykinesia, and gait instability) occur. However, in dementia with Lewy bodies (unlike in Parkinson disease), cognitive and extrapyramidal symptoms usually begin within 1 year of each other. Also, the extrapyramidal symptoms differ from those of Parkinson disease; in dementia with Lewy bodies, tremor does not occur early, rigidity of axial muscles with gait instability occurs early, and deficits tend to be symmetric. Repeated falls are common. Fluctuating cognitive function is a relatively specific feature of dementia with Lewy bodies. Periods of being alert, coherent, and oriented may alternate with periods of being confused and unresponsive to questions, usually over a period of days to weeks but sometimes during the same interview. Memory is impaired, but the impairment appears to result more from deficits in alertness and attention than in memory acquisition; thus, short-term recall is affected less than digit span memory (ability to repeat 7 digits forward and 5 backward). Patients may stare into space for long periods. Excessive daytime drowsiness is common. Visuospatial and visuoconstructional abilities (tested by block design, clock drawing, or figure copying) are affected more than other cognitive deficits. Visual hallucinations are common and often threatening, unlike the benign hallucinations of Parkinson disease. Auditory, olfactory, and tactile hallucinations are less common. Delusions occur in 50 to 65% of patients and are often complex and bizarre, compared with the simple persecutory ideation common in Alzheimer disease. Autonomic dysfunction is common, and unexplained syncope may result. Autonomic dysfunction may occur simultaneously with or occur after onset of cognitive deficits. Extreme sensitivity to antipsychotics is typical. Sleep problems are common. Many patients have rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder, a parasomnia characterized by vivid dreams without the usual physiologic paralysis of skeletal muscles during REM sleep. As a result, dreams may be acted out, sometimes injuring the bed partner. Parkinson disease dementia: In Parkinson disease dementia (unlike in dementia with Lewy bodies), cognitive impairment that leads to dementia typically begins 10 to 15 years after motor symptoms have appeared. Parkinson disease dementia may affect multiple cognitive domains including attention, memory, and visuospatial, constructional, and executive functions. Executive dysfunction typically occurs earlier and is more common in Parkinson disease dementia than in Alzheimer disease. Psychiatric symptoms (eg, hallucinations, delusions) appear to be less frequent and/or less severe than in dementia with Lewy bodies. In Parkinson disease dementia, postural instability and gait abnormalities are more common, motor decline is more rapid, and falls are more frequent than in Parkinson disease without dementia. Diagnosis: Clinical criteria, Neuroimaging to rule out other disorders. Diagnosis is clinical, but sensitivity and specificity are poor. A general diagnosis of dementia requires all of the following: Cognitive or behavioral (neuropsychiatric) symptoms interfere with the ability to function at work or do usual daily activities. These symptoms represent a decline from previous levels of functioning. These symptoms are not explained by delirium or a major psychiatric disorder. Evaluation of cognitive function involves taking a history from the patient and from someone who knows the patient plus doing a bedside mental status examination or, if bedside testing is inconclusive, formal neuropsychologic testing. Diagnosis of dementia with Lewy bodies is considered probable if 2 of the following 4 core features are present and is considered possible if only one is present: Fluctuations in cognition, Visual hallucinations, Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder, Parkinsonism. Supportive evidence includes repeated falls, syncope, autonomic dysfunction, excessive daytime sleepiness, and sensitivity to antipsychotics. Overlap of symptoms in dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson disease dementia may complicate diagnosis: When motor deficits (eg, tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity) precede and are more severe than cognitive impairment, Parkinson disease dementia is usually diagnosed. When early cognitive impairment (particularly executive dysfunction) and behavioral disturbances predominate, dementia with Lewy bodies is usually diagnosed. Patients with dementia with Lewy bodies often have impaired alertness, which is more characteristic of delirium than dementia; thus, evaluation for delirium should be done, particularly for common causes such as: Drugs and medications, particularly anticholinergics, psychoactive drugs, and opioids, Dehydration, Infection. Other causes of dementia should also be ruled out. The parkinsonian features in dementia with Lewy bodies (eg, axial rigidity, falls) may occur in early stages of other neurodegenerative disorders (eg, progressive supranuclear palsy [PSP]). People with PSP may also develop subcortical dementia. Identifying other characteristic features of PSP, such as impairment of vertical eye movements and midbrain atrophy on midsagittal MRI (hummingbird or King Penguin sign), may help differentiate PSP from dementia with Lewy bodies. CT and MRI show no characteristic changes in Lewy body dementia but can initially help rule out other causes of dementia. Single-photon emission CT (SPECT) of the brain with 123I-FP-CIT (N-3-fluoropropyl-2-beta-carbomethoxy-3beta-[4-iodophenyl]-tropane), a radioactive tracer of dopamine transporter, can help detect basal ganglia dopaminergic neuronal dysfunction and function as a biomarker for diagnosing dementia with Lewy bodies. Other imaging tests that may help identify dementia with Lewy bodies include Positron emission tomography (PET) of the brain with fluorine-18 (18F)–labeled deoxyglucose (fluorodeoxyglucose, or FDG). Myocardial scintigraphy with iodine 123-meta-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG; in dementia with Lewy bodies, cardiac uptake of MIBG is reduced because the postganglionic cardiac sympathetic system is denervated). However, these tests are not routinely used in clinical practice. Confirmation of REM sleep behavior disorder using polysomnography may help establish the diagnosis of dementia with Lewy bodies. Definitive diagnosis requires autopsy samples of brain tissue. Treatment: Supportive care. Treatment for dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson disease dementia is generally supportive. For example, the environment and should be bright, cheerful, and familiar, and it should be designed to reinforce orientation (eg, placement of large clocks and calendars in the room). Measures to ensure patient safety (eg, signal monitoring systems for patients who wander) should be implemented. Troublesome cognitive and behavioral symptoms, such as hallucinations, paranoid thoughts, irritability, and aggressiveness, are treated with medications only when other measures are ineffective. Medications: Cholinesterase inhibitors may improve cognitive function and may be helpful in patients who have dementia with Lewy bodies or Parkinson disease dementia. Rivastigmine, a cholinesterase inhibitor, can be used to treat dementia with Lewy bodies (and Parkinson disease dementia). A starting dose of 1.5 mg orally twice a day may be titrated upward as needed to 6 mg twice a day to try to improve cognition. Other cholinesterase inhibitors may also be used. In about half of patients with dementia with Lewy bodies, extrapyramidal symptoms respond to antiparkinsonian medications, but psychiatric symptoms may worsen. If such medications are needed, levodopa is preferred. In dementia with Lewy bodies, traditional antipsychotics, even at very low doses, tend to acutely worsen extrapyramidal symptoms and are best avoided. Pimavanserin, a nondopaminergic selective inverse agonist of the serotonin 5-HT-2A receptor, can be used to treat psychosis (hallucinations, delusions) in patients with Parkinson disease dementia. End-of-life issues: Because insight and judgment deteriorate in patients with dementia, appointment of a family member, guardian, or lawyer to oversee finances may be necessary. Early in dementia, before the patient is incapacitated, the patient’s wishes about care should be clarified, and financial and legal arrangements (eg, durable power of attorney, durable power of attorney for health care) should be made. When these documents are signed, the patient’s capacity should be evaluated, and evaluation results recorded. Decisions about artificial feeding and treatment of acute disorders are best made before the need develops. In advanced dementia, palliative measures may be more appropriate than highly aggressive interventions or hospital care. Key Points: Because Lewy bodies occur in dementia with Lewy bodies and in Parkinson disease, some experts hypothesize that the 2 disorders are part of the same synucleinopathy affecting the central and peripheral nervous systems. Suspect dementia with Lewy bodies if dementia develops nearly simultaneously with parkinsonian features and when dementia is accompanied by fluctuations in cognition, loss of attention, vivid dreams, psychiatric symptoms (eg, visual hallucinations; complex, bizarre delusions), and autonomic dysfunction. Suspect Parkinson disease dementia if dementia begins years after parkinsonian features, particularly if executive dysfunction occurs early. Consider use of rivastigmine and sometimes other cholinesterase inhibitors to try to improve cognition in patients who have dementia with Lewy bodies or Parkinson disease dementia.";https://www.msdmanuals.com/professional/neurologic-disorders/delirium-and-dementia/dementia-with-lewy-bodies-and-parkinson-disease-dementia?query=lewy%20bodies
